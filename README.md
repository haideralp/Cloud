## AWS - Best Practices To Implement: 
 - Naming convention eng_122_haider_ec2
 - AWS services to be used between 09:00 - 18:00 stop or terminate

 - terminate services once you finished working. 
 - Do not delete anyone else's services
 - MUST NOT SHARE AWS ACCOUNT DETAILS WITH ANYONE - SO NO GITHUB REPO
